    <p>An integer is a variable type (a variable is effectively a way to store data).</p>

    myInt1 = 40; // When we first assign a value to an integer, this is called initialisation. Here, we have set the value of the integer variable, myInt1, to 40.

    int myInt2 = 31; // This declares and initialises an integer value in a single line of code, effectively the same as the two lines above, except of course we've set this integer to 31 not 40.

    cout<<"Value 1: "&lt&ltmyInt1&lt&ltendl; // Output the contents of myInt1 into the console
    cout<<"Value 2: "&lt&ltmyInt2&lt&ltendl; // Output the contents of myInt2 into the console

    cout<<"Multiplied: "&lt&ltmyInt1*myInt2; // outputs the numbers multiplied together. This could also be written similar to the line below
    int divided = myInt1/myInt2&lt&ltendl; // Divide myInt1 by myInt2. Note, because they are stored in an integer, the resulting number will be rounded
    cout<<"Divided: "&lt&ltdivided&lt&ltendl; // Output the contents of the variable divided
    cout<<"Added: "&lt&ltmyInt1+myInt2&lt&ltendl;
    cout<<"Subtracted: "&lt&ltmyInt1-myInt2&lt&ltendl;

    <p>There are many ways to write code to iterate through the contents of a string. Here, we cover 3 methods.</p>
    <p>Option 1 (using substrings)</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">#include &ltiostream>
#include &ltstring>

using namespace std;

/*
Notes on string.length() and why i < myString.length() not i <= length():

One thing to note, as that when we're getting the position of a character, substring, element of an array etc, the computer starts counting from 0.
Hence, here's what the string "hello" would look like to the computer:
Index / Position (i): 0 1 2 3 4
Character:              h e l l o

However, notice that this string has 5 letters, and the last letter is at position 4?
That's why we use < not <= in the scenario below, because if we used <=, on the last iteration of the for loop, the computer would try to find position 5 (which doesn't exist), and would error / cause unexpected results.
*/

int main()
{
    string myString = "hello world";

    for (int i = 0; i < myString.length(); i++) // Set integer i to zero at the start (i referencing index, the position of the element in the string that we're checking); Iterate while i is smaller than the length (note you cannot use <=, see comment above); Every iteration (every tine the code in the loop runs once), we increment i (add 1 to i)
    {
        cout&lt&ltmyString.substr(i, 1)&lt&ltendl; // Prints every character on a new line
        // above, the 1 signifies that we're selecting 1 character, and this is returned to the code. For instance, if we used 2, the substr would return 2 Characters
        // note that substr returns a string, not a character variable type
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Option 2 (uses subscription)</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">#include &ltiostream>
#include &ltstring>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string myString = "hello world";

    for (int i = 0; i < myString.length(); i++) // Set integer i to zero at the start (i referencing index, the position of the element in the string that we're checking); Iterate while i is smaller than the length (note you cannot use <=, see comment above); Every iteration (every tine the code in the loop runs once), we increment i (add 1 to i)
    {
        cout&lt&ltmyString[i]&lt&ltendl; // Prints every character on a new line (here the [i] signafies that we're selecting a character from position i)
        // note that this returns a variable of type character, NOT a string. This can be useful when used in conjunction with the ctypes.h library
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Option 3 (iterate without i)</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-cpp">#include &ltiostream>
#include &ltstring>

using namespace std;

/*
Only use this option when we don't care about the variable i, in a case where we would have only used i to extract the character.
*/

int main()
{
    string myString = "hello world";

    for (char &myCharacter: myString) // you may find this easier to read than option 2.
    {
        cout&lt&ltmyCharacter&lt&ltendl; // Prints every character on a new line
    }
